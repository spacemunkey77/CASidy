## About CASidy

CASidy is a personal project set up to automate lights and monitor sensors throughout my home. It integrates with the [Konnected Alarm System](https://konnected.io/products/konnected-alarm-panel-wired-alarm-system-conversion-kit), [Wemos](https://www.belkin.com/support-article/?articleNum=226110), [Hue Light Bulbs](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us), and [Samsung SmartThings](https://www.samsung.com/us/smartthings/). It uses IFTTT to send push notifications and Twilio to send SMS notifications in case the IFTTT system is down.

The automation system also integrates with IFTTT to receive geolocation information when the home owner leaves a geo restricted area to control the sensors and lights of the home.
